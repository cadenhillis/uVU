# uVU
A tiny analog VU meter

Uses the LM3915 to do a fun little VU display on an LED bargraph.

The pcb is a little hard to assemble, but bending the bargraph's pins out before soldering everything helps.

I didn't get great results with the two tuning pots -- they seemed to almost fight eachother.
Maybe adding some smoothing to make the sound wave more DC-like or only having 1 pot in the future will help things.
